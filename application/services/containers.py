"""Hierarchical container pickers.

Shared by the task inspector ("Project") and the project/folder inspector
("Inside"): both need a ``<select>`` whose option labels carry the full folder
breadcrumb (e.g. ``📁  Work / Acme / Website``) instead of a bare name, so a
project nested several folders deep is unambiguous.

One query fetches every project/folder/section in scope; ancestor paths resolve
in-memory through a pk→item map (``.pk`` on a reference reads the DBRef, not the
document, so there are no per-row lookups).
